Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

For consistent style, it is important that you use uppercase
and lowercase consistently.  In the future, please keep this in
mind.  I understand why you put your friends' names in uppercase,
but in the future, if you're doing your method names in lowercase
or camel case, then do ALL of them in lowercase or camel case,
regardless of normal English capitalization rules.  In code, those
cases take on extra meaning to somebody else reading your code,
and if you're not consistent, the code gets very confusing.  I didn't
take off any points for it this time, but keep it in mind for the
future.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the methods that
were letters and the methods that were shared paragraphs.
